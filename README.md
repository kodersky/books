# List of the books I read

Try to polish my English as it is not my first language. Below you will find a list of books I have read in English (latest on the top) with a few words about each of them.

It is hard to rank a book as this is a very subjective topic. Depending on the mood, place, and sometimes age.

Max score: 5 :beer:

## Looking for Alaska by John Green :beer: :beer: :beer: :beer:

I don't know why I read this book. Maybe I wanted something like Catcher In The Rye? It was not exactly the same... The book is very light and fast to read. More for teenagers. But it was still a fun read - and I am not so young.

The blowjob scene was really unnecessary.

## SPIN by Robert Charles Wilson :beer: :beer: :beer: :beer:

I found this book when viewing the winners' list of the Hugo Award. It won the 2006 Best Novel award.

Prepare yourself for slow action. Prepare yourself for more fiction than science-fiction. The overall idea of the book is great. The plot is simple. Few characters to follow. But I wanted more from it.

There are 2 more books in the series. But I heard action in them is even slower than in this one. So I am not sure if I will ever continue to read to rest. But as I said. The idea is great.

Looks like an author who likes jazz, and he mentioned a few artist names on the pages. That's how I discovered this lovely song  - The Girl from Ipanema by Stan Getz.

## Blindsight by Peter Watts :beer: :beer: :beer: :beer: :beer:

Hard sci-fi. Page turner. Dark, harsh. Everything balanced. I doubt if this author can write something as good as this anytime soon, if ever. That's why I didn't follow up with the next book in the series. Maybe later.
